# OpenFin FDC3 Service


## Overview

OpenFin FDC3 API uses the new Services framework to expose its API to consuming applications.  You can see the documentation for these APIs here:  http://cdn.openfin.co/jsdocs/alpha/fin.desktop.Service.html.

This project consist of 2 parts:
1. The FDC3 Provider, taking care of intents, context and resolving them (UI)
2. The FDC3 Client, exposing API's for applications to handle/raise intents with contexts

### Dependencies
- OpenFin version >= 8.56.30.42 
- RVM >= 4.2.0.33 

### Features
* Raise an FDC3 Intent
* Resolve an FDC3 Intent
* Open an application with an intent/context
* Attach listeners for Intents and Contexts

### Run Locally
- To run the project locally the npm scripts require git bash.
- Windows support only.
- Node 8.11 LTS.
```bash
npm install
npm run build:demo
npm run start
```

## Getting Started

Using the FDC3 service is done in two steps, add the service to application manifest and import the API:

### Manifest declaration

To ensure the service is running, you must declare it in your application config.

```
"services": [
    {
        "name": "fdc3"
    }
]

```

### Import the API

To use the API, you must first include it in your application. 

```bash
npm install openfin-fdc3
```

## Roadmap
This is a WIP living implementation of the FDC3 API.


## Known Issues


## Project Structure

All code lives under the src directory which can be broken down into 5 areas: client, demo, provider, test and ui.

* src
 * client - the service client
 * demo - the demo config/html (for testing the service itself)
 * provider - the service provider
 * test - all the tests
 * ui - the intent/context resolution ui

## Project Helpers

We use a handful of NPM scripts to handle most of the typical tasks in a project like compile, stage, run, etc.

* build - run webpack and stage (production)
* build:demo - run webpack and stage (development)
* start - runs the server/apps, must run either build command prior
* test - runs all project tests


## Build

The project is built and staged to the ./build directory.  This directory is exactly what would be deployed to the production CDN.

* build
 * client.js - the compiled service client
 * demo/ - the demo files
 * provider.js - the compiled service provider
 * ui - the compiled intent/context resolution UI
