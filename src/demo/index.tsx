/*
 * This file defines the entry point for all of the applications in this project. This "bootstrap" is intended to allow
 * the creation of many small, simple applications whilst avoiding boilerplate.
 * 
 * Each application has it's own "app.json" file, but each file shares the same HTML page. This file will check the 
 * UUID of the current application in order to determine which React component to create and add to the DOM.
 * 
 * For demo purposes, we also need to have multiple applications capable of handling the same intent. This is done by
 * making the demo applications skinnable, to create several similar applications that differ only in colour scheme.
 * Whilst these applications clearly share the same code, they should be assumed to be completely unrelated 
 * applications, likely made by different vendors, that are both capable of providing the same funcionality.
